# Git 1-2-3

**In summary, if you want to contribute to a project, the simplest way is to:**

1. Find a project you want to contribute to.
2. Fork it.
   1. When you **fork** a repository, you create a copy of the original repository (upstream repository) but the repository remains on your GitHub account. Whereas, when you **clone** a repository, the repository is copied on to your local machine with the help of **Git**.
3. Clone it to your local system.
4. **Make a** new branch.
5. Make your changes.
6. Push it back to your repo.
7. Click the Compare & **pull request** button.
8. Click **Create pull request** to open a new **pull request**.
   1. source branch would be your branch you have worked on, and target branch would be the branch you want to contribute e.x main.

```bash
# When we starts to work, we need to know before hand, which branch we are going to work on. Git is always in one branch or a commit <detach state>. If we already have a branch and we don't want to create new, we simply checkout that branch
$ git checkout <branch> //change current branch

#if we don't have a branch, then we need to know, from which branch we want to take the branch out. that depends, where you want to contribute in. If you want to contribute to "main" branch , you need to take branch from "main". If you want to contribute to any other branch, then you checkout a new branch based on that "any-other" branch.

#First
$ git checkout main // or the branch you want to contribute to
#Then
$ git checkout -b <new_branch_name> //create and change branch

# git pull - before starting work, if someone else might be merging code into that branch. This command will sync your local repo with changes made in remote <origin> repo
1. $ git pull

# After doing a unit of work which is nice to have in a single commit <bookmark>, commit that work. Don't wait till end-of-day. For that, first we have to stage the changes.

2. $ git add . //stage all files with changes after working. Note "." after add
OR
$ git add <SPECIFIC_FILE/DIRECTORY>

# Make a commit. Commit means kinda bookmark in the history of the branch. After it is merged via Pull request to main branch, it became part of the history of main branch.

3. $ git commit //opens interactive shell for type commit message
OR
$ git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"

# After we have made a commit, now we need to send this commit to remote/origin branch of yours.
4. $ git push //if already tracking a remote branch
OR 
$ git push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME> 

# You
```
